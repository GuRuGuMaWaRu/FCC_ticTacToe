## FreeCodeCamp Front End Project - Build a Tic Tac Toe Game

## User Stories

- [ ] I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- [ ] My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- [ ] I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Thoughts

This time I quite easily had an idea to make two separate color schemes for each side. Also it quickly occured to me that this would be a great place to work with canvas - actually this was the first time I used it. All in all I still like its minimalistic look - so cool! And one more thing - everyone was pining about how it was easy to create a perfect adversary and how boring it was to play against it, so my CPU adversary makes mistakes from time to time (just like any human does) and it makes the game much more enjoyable!
